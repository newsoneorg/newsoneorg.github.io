                <h2>BJP to enact Love Jihad law if voted to power in Kerala: Chouhan</h2>
                <h4><i>Battle in Kerala</i></h4>
                <h5>NEWSONE.ORG CORRESPONDENT</h5>
                <h6><u>Bhopal, April 3, 2021</u></h6>
                
                <font face = "Helvetica" size = "4" style="line-height: 1.8;">
					
<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Madhya Pradesh chief
	minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said in poll bound Kerala on Friday that BJP
	would enact a Love Jihad law over there if voted to power, as per BJP. </span></p>
	
	<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Madhya Pradesh government
	led by Chouhan has enacted a similar law here with a provision for harsh punishment
	in case of any conversion by way of lure, coercion or intimidation and also in
	case of inter-faith marriages by concealing one's identity. </span></p>
	
	<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Kerala will witness polling
	on April 6 for its state assembly. Counting of votes will take place on May 2
	along with the results of West Bengal, Assam, Tamil Nadu and Pondicherry legislative
	assembly elections. </span></p>
	
	<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Addressing three public
	meetings at three different places Chouhan lashed out at the ruling LDF (Left
	Democratic Front), Congress led UDF (United Democratic Front) and also Congress
	MP Rahul Gandhi who represents Wayanad parliamentary constituency in Lok Sabha.
	</span></p>
	
	<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Chouhan who often uses acronyms
	of political opponents these days to attack them said, LDF means lawlessness, destructive
	and failed and UDF means unconstitutional, danger and fake.</span></p>
	
	<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Chouhan reiterated, R stands
	for rejected i.e. one who was rejected by the country, A stands for absent-minded,
	H is for hopeless, U stands for useless and L means liar i.e. one who often
	tells a lie.</span></p>
	
	<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Chouhan whose government
	recently entered into an agreement with Kerala to replicate its 'Responsible tourism'
	model here again used acronym in trying to convince the voters of Kerala that
	if BJP was voted to power it would usher Kerala to a new path of development
	and give a new identity to the South India state. </span></p>
	
	<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>K - Knowledgeable Kerala,
	E - Energetic Kerala, R - Responsible Kerala, A - Able Kerala, L -
	Large-hearted Kerala and A - Aatmnirbhar Kerala, said the MP CM about the plan
	of the BJP to give a new identity to the state once it was voted to power.</span></p>
	
	<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>He alleged, "The LDF and the
	UDF have converted Kerala which is known as the God's own country, into a land
	of scams and violence. Alternatively, they rule 5 years as these are two sides
	of the same coin which have no concern about development of the state."" </span></p>
	
	<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Chouhan said, "The LDF and
	the UDF have handed over Kerala into the hands of Jihadis. Here, Love-Jihad is
	going on and crimes are being committed to spoil many lives by misleading them through
	lure, enticement, intimidation and impersonation. I have come from the land of
	Madhya Pradesh. We have put in place a law against Love-Jihad. We are not
	against love but Jihad. Wherever BJP is there it will not allow Love-Jihad. The
	offenders of such a crime will be punished with 10 years imprisonment."</span></p>
	
	<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>
	
	<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>WHAT IS LOVE-JIHAD</span></b></p>
	
	<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>As per Oxford dictionary
	Love-Jihad is "A holy war undertaken by Muslims against unbelievers. The name comes
	from Arabic&nbsp;jih&#257;d, literally "effort", expressing, in Muslim thought,
	struggle on behalf of God and Islam."</span></p>
