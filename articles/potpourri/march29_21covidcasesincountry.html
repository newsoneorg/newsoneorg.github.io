                 hence the state government in Madhya Pradesh is alarmed over the situation and has announced a number of measures including Sunday lockdown
                  in certain districts to check spread of the virus. </p>
                <p>As per a report released by Press Information Bureau (PIB), Maharashtra has reported the highest daily new cases at 40414 followed by Karnataka
