                <h5>NEWSONE.ORG CORRESPONDENT</h5>
                <h6><u>Bhopal, March 29, 2021</u></h6>
                
                <font face = "Helvetica" size = "4" style="line-height: 1.8;">
                <p>
                    Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh figured among 8 states in India that reported 84.5% of the daily new Covid-cases in the country in the 
                    past 24 hours, as per an official release.</p>
                <p> The other six states include Maharashtra, Karnataka, Punjab, Gujarat, Kerala and Tamil Nadu. Madhya Pradesh shares its border with Maharashtra and Gujarat,
                 hence the state government in Madhya Pradesh is alarmed over the situation and has announced a number of measures including Sunday lockdown
                  in certain districts to check spread of the virus. </p>
                <p>As per a report released by Press Information Bureau (PIB), Maharashtra has reported the highest daily new cases at 40414 followed by Karnataka 
                with 3082 and Punjab with 2870 cases in the past 24 hours out of the total 68020 new Covid-19 cases reported from across the country.</p>

            Punjab with 69 deaths, Chhattisgarh 15, Karnataka and Kerala 12 each and Tamil Nadu and Madhya Pradesh 11 deaths each, as per the release.</p>
        <p>Eighteen states/union territories (UTs) have higher deaths per million than the national average (117). Similarly, 18 states/UTs have lower deaths

    <p>On Monday, Madhya Pradesh reported 2323 new Covid cases with 9 deaths, as per the state government’s health bulletin released on Monday evening. </p>
<p>Alarmingly, as per the bulletin, it’s not only Indore and Bhopal which continue to report high number of new daily cases. While Indore reported the maximum
