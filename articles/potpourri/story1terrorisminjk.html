            </p> “There has been no civilian death in law & order incidents in J&K after abrogation of Article 370. However, due to terrorist violence supported from across the border,
            terrorists deliberately target civilians to put pressure on security forces. Despite the attempts of terrorists, the number of civilian deaths in terrorist violence 
            and cross firing has decreased post-abrogation of Article 370”, stated Minister of state for Home Affairs G Kishan Reddy in the written reply.</p>

                an ex-gratia of Rs 1 lakh. Further, the family members of the deceased civilian have an option either to choose for appointment in government service 
                or Rs 4 lakhs as cash compensation in lieu of the government service.  In respect of the persons who sustain injuries in such incidents, 
                ex-gratia as per the following scale is provided: Rs. 0.75 lakh for permanent disability; Rs 0.05 lakh for serious injury (hospitalization more 
                than 24 hours); Rs 0.01 lakh for injury (hospitalization less than 24 hours) and Rs500 for minor injuries.”</p>
            </p> In addition, under the MHA Scheme titled “Central Scheme for Assistance to Civilian Victims/Family of Victims of Terrorist/ Communal/LWE
