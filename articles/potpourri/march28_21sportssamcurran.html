                <h3>Brilliant unbeaten knock of 95 that almost cost India team its match & series win</h3>
                <h4>Contest proved Lagaan II, though in real life, to give superb gift to country on Holi </h4>
                <h5>NEWSONE.ORG CORRESPONDENT</h5>
                <h5>BHOPAL, March 28, 2021</h5>
                
                <font face = "Helvetica" size = "4" style="line-height: 1.8;">
                    <p>It’s a brilliant unbeaten knock of 95 runs off 83 balls, though not flawless, hit by 22-year-old Sam Curran in his just 8th match that almost cost
                             Virat Kohli’s India team its match and series win in the third one day international (ODI) cricket match played between India and England 
                             cricket teams in Pune on Sunday. </p>

                        <p>In the nail-biting match Curran who was dropped on 22 by Hardik Pandya smashed 3 sixes and 9 fours to get his first half-century 
                        in one-day cricket and, of course, his highest score in ODI to earn the Player of the Match award. Thanks to sloppy fielding by India 
                        team which saw almost half a dozen catches being dropped Curran appeared to have snatched the victory single-handedly but for excellent 
                        last over bowled by T Natarajan. </p>
                        
                <p>The All-rounder took one important wicket too i.e. of Rishabh Pant in 5 overs conceding 43 runs and came in between India’s early win as was 
                being expected when England lost its 7th wicket in Moeen Ali at the score of 200 while chasing the huge target of 330 and remaining 19.3 overs yet to play. </p>
                        
        <p>Curran smashed 3 sixes and 9 fours giving tense moments not only to India team but also billions of cricket lovers for more than an hour or so when they 
        sat glued to the TV sets praying for India team’s win.</p>

        <h6>Pix: Courtesy: ICC (taken from its Twitter page)</h6>
                        
<p>Times of India in its coverage of the match says, “A game to remember for the ages to come. Take a bow, Sam Curran. Though England lost the game, 
Curran becomes a hero. Someone with such little experience has hung around to give India a run for their money. At one stage, England were all out of 
the game but this little lad had other plans as he went about his business to take the game to the last over, last ball.”</p>
                        
<p>It’s not only British players and media but Indian players too showered praises on this Player of the Match.</p>
                        
<p> Former Indian cricketer Virender Sehwag tweeted, “Sam Curran is some talent and he nearly pulled it off for England..”</p>
                        
<p>The Guardian quoted Kohli as saying ‘We knew it was going to be a tough game, England’s not going to throw in the towel at any stage. 
Sam played a really good innings to keep them in the hunt, but our bowlers kept taking wickets and made sure that we put enough pressure on them, 
to make sure they got over the line’. </p>
                        
<p>Sam Curran got appreciation from International Cricket Council (ICC) too. </p>
                        
<p> The ICC on its official Twitter page posted, “95* runs, 83 balls, 9 fours and 3 sixes- England fell just short, but what a performance that was from Sam Curran!”</p>
                        
<p>Chennai Super Kings team said it all in its brief tweet- One man sam! Whattey fight!</p>
                        
<p>However, Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan, Rishabh Pant, Hardik Pandya, Krunal Pandya and Shardul Thakur with bat and Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Shardul Thakur,
 Hardik Pandya and T Natarajan with ball contributed chiefly to India’s victory celebrated across India on the eve of Holi as a gift from Team India.</p>
                        
<p>It was an excellent opening batting by Rohit and Shikhar unlike the first two ODIs of the series that India team scored 103 in first 15 overs. 
On the contrary, England opening batsmen pair who hit 135 in the first ODI and 110 in the second before parting ways couldn’t repeat their performance 
in the third ODI and first wicket fell on the score of merely 14 and second on 28. </p>
                        
<p> Rishabh Pant who played an important role in India’s historic series win against Australia a few months back showed why he is a 
special player who can’t be intimidated by any kind of bowling attack. He hit 78 off just 62 balls with 4 sixes and 5 fours to become 
top scorer for India with 78 runs. His knock was superb given the fact India had lost its fourth wicket in KL Rahul at the score of 157. 
Pant and Hardik Pandya added next 99 runs in their partnership that laid solid foundation for India’s total of 329. </p>
                        
<p>Like Curran from England side Rishabh too scored his highest ODI score and both remained top scorer in the third ODI from their respective teams. </p>
                        
<p>With England team on opposition side the win proved not reel but real Lagaan II when the match was decided in the last over. </p>
                        
<p>While Bhuvaneshwar Kumar sent back both openers among his three wickets Shardul Thakur gave much required break to India at regular 
intervals with his four wickets. T Natarajan bowled excellent last over when England needed 13 to win the match and series. </p>
                        
<p>Bhuvneshwar Kumar and T Natarajan got special praise from the opponents for bowling in an excellent manner while keeping their nerve.</p>
                        
<p> Jonny Bairstow who was adjudged the Player of the series said Bhuvneshwar Kumar was a very good bowler whom he also knew as both were 
teammates in the Indian T20 league and that Natarajan bowled extremely well in the final over. </p>
                        
<p>While praising India team ICC too had special words for Natarajan. </p>
                        
<p>ICC said, “India win! Natarajan gives away just six runs in the final over, giving his team a seven-run victory. It means India take the ODI series 2-1!”</p>
                        
                        
<p> <b><h4>WHO SAID WHAT?</h4></b></p>
                        
<p> Former Indian cricketer Virendra Sehwag said in his tweet while praising Sam Curran said, “…But in the end, Khaali haath aaye thhey,
 khaali haath jaayenge England waale. Good win for Team India but across formats this has been a well fought series.”</p>
                        
<p>Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) said, “Things went right down to the wire but TeamIndia held their nerve to win the third and final 
India vs England ODI to secure a series win.” </p>
<p>Wisden Cricket in its tweet said, “Even with the likes of Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Shami and Ravindra Jadeja unavailable, India sealed yet another series win.”</p>
<p>Former Indian cricketer Akash Chopra said, “Game worthy of a series decider between two top sides. England’s belief in their Gameplan is exemplary. 
India’s tenacity to win do-or-die games is the stuff that champion teams are made of. Thoroughly enjoyed calling the entire England’s tour of India.”</p>
