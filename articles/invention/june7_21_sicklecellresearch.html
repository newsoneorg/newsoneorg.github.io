<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span style='font-size:16.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Researchers
in India have developed a new blood testing device which is world's first AI based
portable device for instant diagnosis of sickle cell anaemia. This gives
results in less than 5 minutes, that too in 1/10th of the time and cost of
presently used test for diagnosis, according to Prof Dr Nisanth
KM Nambison from Government Homeopathic Medical
Colleg, Hospital, Bhopal who happens to be one of the mentors of the
researchers. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span style='font-size:16.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Sickle
cell disease (SCD), an inherited disorder of the red blood cells, is a major
public health problem which is characterised by repeated episodes of
debilitating pain, which are a common and repeated cause of illness and
hospitalisation, says a note on research. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span style='font-size:16.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>India,
with a population of 1.3 billion individuals, is estimated to be home to over
50% of the world's patients with SCD. The disease is most prevalent across
central India, like a belt extending from south-eastern Gujarat to
south-western Odisha. Over a million people have sickle cell disease in India
today. There are nearly 2,00,000 babies born with the condition every year.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span style='font-size:16.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>This
HPOS (High Performance Optical Sensing) device has been developed by team of
researchers the Department of Instrumentation and Applied Physics, Indian
Institute of Science, Bangalore-Rajesh Srinivasan, Eugene Christo V R, Prateek
class=SpellE>Katare, Aravind Venukumar under
the mentorship of Prof Dr Sai Siva Gorthi from the
department and Prof Dr Nisanth KM 
Nambison from Government Homeopathic Medical College,
Hospital, Bhopal (Madhya Pradesh), as per the note. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span style='font-size:16.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>According
to Dr Nambison, the AI (artificial intelligence) based
revolutionary indigenously developed portable palmtop rechargeable device uses
mere 1/4th of a drop of blood and can be deployed even in the remotest village
for testing at the PoC (Point of care) thus bringing down the cost of
transportation and curtailing the turnaround time in reaching diagnosis which
proves to be lifesaving.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span style='font-size:16.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>"The
quicker the diagnosis of serious illnesses, the better for the person, his
family, and the society. But huge upfront cost of these imported diagnostic
equipment for sickle cell anaemia and recurring expenses in the form of
consumables makes the test expensive and also time consuming as the test is not
a routine test and is available only at high end labs", states the note on the
research. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span style='font-size:16.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Sickle
cell anemia causes loss to economy because of parents
missing work and/or losing their job to look after children. This adds up to
about Rs 3500 crores (roughly US$500 million) annually. Also, there is loss to
future GDP through childhood deaths that was calculated to be about Rs 1000
Crores (roughly US$150 million) in 2017.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span style='font-size:16.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Sickle
cell anaemia being a congenital and hereditary genetic disease it is
becoming a significant health burden in India. Hence,the only way of
tackling this huge healthcare burden is by the way of mass screening of
individuals and prevention through avoidance of high-risk marriages. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span style='font-size:16.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>In
India, Madhya Pradesh has the highest burden of sickle cell anaemia. Dr 
class=SpellE>Nambison said he faced lots of hardships in the diagnosis
of sickle cell anaemia in the deep tribal villages of MP. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span style='font-size:16.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>"I
faced challenges not only in the turnaround time taken for the diagnosis but
also the amount of blood drawn from the already anaemic patient that was much difficult
and painful. This is when I met Prof Dr Sai Gorthi at
IISc Bangalore. Through the mutual collaboration and hard work of the researchers world's first AI Based portable device was
invented for instant diagnosis of sickle cell anaemia. This invention will not
only make the process easier but also save time. It is also very economical,"
said Dr Nambison. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span style='font-size:16.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>According
to Dr Nambison, as of now USA tech based imported
HPLC machines used for the diagnosis of sickle cell anaemia costs 10 lakhs
upwards with high recurring and high operational cost. These machines are
bulky, needs 3-5 ml blood of the patients, and are only available in
sophisticated air-conditioned labs. Therefore, remote blood collection needs
transportation in 24 hours, temperature maintenance of 2 to 8 degrees and
requires a team of 4-5 skilled people. This adds up to the cost and delayed
turnaround time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span style='font-size:16.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The
new technology used in the device makes it portable, mere 1/4th drop (5 ml) of
blood is required for diagnosis of sickle cell anaemia and the test can be
performed at patien's doorstep. It is 10 times cheaper than the currently used
HPLC machines priced at around Rs 60,000 to Rs 70,000. The health worker does
not need any special skill to operate this device. This invention is a
wonderful example of Make-in-India &amp; Self-reliant India.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span style='font-size:16.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>"While
it takes 25 to 30 minutes to get the test results from an HPLC machine, we get
the results of the test with HPOS Device in less than 5 minutes with this newly
invented device," said Dr Nambison.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
