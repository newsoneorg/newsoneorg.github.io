on his Facebook page even as there is a debate going on in bureaucratic, political and other circles if the conduct of the then chief secretary of 
West Bengal Alapan Bandyopadhyay was justified in not receiving the Prime Minister Narendra Modi and later not attending his meeting: 
It's matter of great concern how a civil servant of
All India Service (IAS) working in state cadre should behave. A recent and
glaring case is that of ex-Chief Secretary of West Bengal. Here I put an
article just posted by PK Basu, a very senior retired

mso-fareast-language:EN-IN'>The recent kerfuffle between the Centre and West
Bengal government over recalling of its former Chief Secretary has brought the
spotlight back on civil servants and the civil service. Before going into the
current problem, it is important to look at the past to see how the civil
servant-politician relation has gone through ups and downs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-language:EN-IN'>We know of many instances where senior secretaries
to government have differed with Chief Ministers and Prime Ministers, but have
been respected for their views. That was during the initial years after
Partition till about the mid-sixties. Then Congress leader and former Prime
Minister Indira Gandhi brought in the concept of "committed bureaucracy" and
the healthy relationship between the <span class=GramE>All India</span> Service
(AIS) and the ministers started deteriorating. That was the watershed moment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Administration, seeking premature retirement when Gandhi overruled his decision
to dismiss a probationer who, in an inebriated state, threatened a colleague

of our public representatives. We have had people with criminal records entering
politics. It no longer remained a dignified calling for which the standards had
been laid down by stalwarts like <span class=SpellE>Bidhan</span> Chandra Roy,

mso-fareast-language:EN-IN'>Slowly, many Chief Ministers became tyrannical
satraps who believed that their word was law. J Jayalalithaa, Lalu Prasad, and
Bansi Lal were vindictive to IAS officers who dared point out the rule of law
to them. The incidents of acid being thrown on a senior IAS officer, IAS
officers being beaten up by goons in Bihar, imprisonment of innocent IAS
officers who dared to express an independent opinion, are numerous. The recent
incident of the Chief Secretary of Delhi being called for a meeting with the
Chief Minister and then assaulted there is, of course, the all-time low.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-language:EN-IN'>Unfortunately, over the years, some officers started
adjusting to the new normal and became yes-men/women. They forgot the oath of
allegiance to the Constitution. They forgot the fact that they only had one
boss: the Constitution of India, and not a Chief Minister. Politicians won
over such officers by playing on their greed: a lucrative posting, a foreign
jaunt, cheap land or house, post-retirement perks, etc. In the civil servants' community 
they are referred to as "Sada Suhagans" those officers who thrive no matter which
political party is in power. They have forgotten that they do not work 'under'
a Chief Minister but 'with' them as a colleague; and definitely not as a
supplicant.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-language:EN-IN'>When Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited West
Bengal on May 28, the chief secretary was supposed to receive him. That's the
rule. Obviously, the chief secretary has to reach the venue much before the PM.
However, Bandyopadhyay did not. This was a clear dereliction of duty and,
worse, insubordination.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-language:EN-IN'>Next, Bandyopadhyay was supposed to make a
presentation to the PM on the damages caused by Cyclone <span class=SpellE>Yaas</span>
and what remedial measures were required. Based on this the central team would
make an assessment of the assistance required. I have been Central Relief
Commissioner and this is a well-established procedure. Unfortunately,

Minister was leaving the state after his visit Bandyopadhyay was yet again
missing. Failing thrice to do his duty gives the impression that he is no
longer thinking and acting like a civil servant, but is willing to be used as a
pawn in a political battle.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

him by the Department of Personnel, Government of India. The departmental

Constitution of India.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

fiasco the people of West Bengal will end up losing. Let me explain. The state
had just faced the brunt of a cyclone and extensive damage had taken place. The
financial cost for rebuilding the state and compensating those who incurred
losses would run up to thousands of crores of rupees. At such a juncture none
less than the Prime Minister has taken time off to assess the situation. It was
a Godsend opportunity where Bandyopadhyay could have presented the state's case
and won more aid for the state. By not doing his duty, the chief secretary
failed the poor, affected people of West Bengal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
