                <h4>Penalty proposed, 10% of FAR limit to be increased to 20%</h4>
                <h5>NEWSONE.ORG CORRESPONDENT</h4>
                <h5>Bhopal, March 24, 2021</h4>
                
                <font face = "Helvetica" size = "4" style="line-height: 1.8;">
                        <p>The state cabinet in Madhya Pradesh approved Madhya Pradesh Municipality Law (Amendment) Bill, 2021 in a bid to, as said the state government spokesperson, 
                                check unauthorised colonies in the state.</p>
                            <p>As per the state government spokesperson, ‘in the said bill, amendments have been proposed to clarify and simplify the process of registration of colonizers, 
                            the process of permitting colony development, so as to encourage the development of authorised colonies. A provision for strict action against 
                            violation of permission for development of the colony has been proposed’. </p>
                        <p> “Stringent provisions have also been made in the amendment bill to provide penalties for the offence of development of unauthorised colonies, 
                        in which it will be possible to curb unauthorised colony development. After the unauthorised colonies are identified, to ensure proper development of 
                        civil infrastructure in them and regularization of the layout of unauthorized colonies and to provide building permission in them, such provisions have 
                        been made in the amendment bill. Apart from this, a provision has been made to increase the present limit of 10% of FAR to 20% to reduce the crime of
                         unauthorised construction”, said the state government spokesperson.</p>
