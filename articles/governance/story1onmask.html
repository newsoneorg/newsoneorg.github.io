                <h4><i>CM makes appeal to people with slogan ‘My Protection-My Mask’</i></h4>
                <h5>NEWSONE.ORG CORRESPONDENT</h5>
                <h6><u>Bhopal, March 22, 2021</u></h6>
                
                <font face = "Helvetica" size = "4" style="line-height: 1.8;">
                        <p>Sirens will blow across the state on Tuesday twice to create awareness among people on wearing masks to protect themselves from Coronavirus, as per an official release.</p>
                        <p>“  After the decision to impose lockdown on Sunday in some cities and to shut the markets at 10 pm in some districts, it has been decided to intensify awareness campaign. 
                            Under this, on Tuesday March 23 at 11 am and 7 pm in the state, everyone should stop their work for two minutes to wear a mask as the siren will blow and they should 
                            also motivate others to use the mask”, says the release.</p>
                        <p>This was discussed at a meeting chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan held with members of the crisis management groups of the districts through a video 
                            conference from the Mantralaya today.</p>
                        <p>Chief Minister Chouhan, “Under all circumstances people of the state have to be saved from the corona infection which is spreading again. 
                        For this, a public awareness campaign is necessary. Everyone has to wear mask for their own safety, adhering to “my protection - my mask”. 
                        Awareness campaign is being started in the state. Whether officers or public representatives or common citizens, all together should make this campaign a success. 
                        We need to intensify our efforts before Corona crisis deepens. Caution has to be increased in districts adjoining Maharashtra.”</p>
                    <p>Chouhan who himself was infected with Corona in July last year and was hospitalised for treatment in a private medical college’s teaching hospital in Bhopal said, 
                    “Mask is the most important means to prevent infection. Along with this, social distancing should be followed. If there is participation of more than twenty persons, 
                    the permission for that programme or meeting should be provided by the district crisis management group. Along with this, necessary decisions should be taken at the 
                    local level in relation to fairs and other festivals as well according to the circumstances of the district.</p>
                    <p>As per the release, it was told during the video conference that out of the total cases of corona infection in the state,
                     about half of the cases are from two big cities- Indore and Bhopal. The share of cities of Indore and Bhopal is 27 and 25 percent respectively of the total cases of the state.</p> 
                    <p><b>NO TO LOCKDOWN</b></p> 
                    <p> “We do not intend to take Madhya Pradesh towards lockdown. The task of bringing the economy back on track in the state has been completed with great 
                    difficulty. Small traders and daily earners suffer the most from the growing corona infection. 
                    All of us must use face mask in the interest of the people of the state. People should be advised tomorrow to use masks at 11 am and 7 pm. 
                    Interrupt those who have not put on masks’, said the CM.</p>
