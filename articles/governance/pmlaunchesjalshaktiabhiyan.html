                            <p>The PM said a major step had also been taken for the Ken-Betwa Link Canal along with introduction of ‘Catch The Rain’ campaign. </p>

                            <h3>CM SHIVRAJ SINGH CHOUHAN</h3>
                            <p>Speaking on the occasion Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said a dream came true today for Madhya Pradesh and its Bundelkhand region in particular, as per an official release from MP government. </p> 
                            <p>The CM said, “Former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee had a dream of connecting the rivers of the country. If the river basins which have more water are linked to river basins with less water, then the water will not go waste and it can be used for irrigation and drinking water purposes. This dream vision has been realized by our glorious and visionary Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The Nadi Jodo Pariyojana is one of the best examples of Sahakari Sanghvad (Cooperative Federalism).” </p>
                            <p>Giving details Chouhan said, “This project will irrigate 811000 hectare unirrigated area in nine districts of Bundelkhand region of Madhya Pradesh. About 41 lakh people will have easy access to drinking water. Contribution of former chief minister Uma Bharti in this project is particularly noteworthy. According to the estimates of the year 2017-18, the cost of the project was about Rs 35111 crores, the present value of which is much more. Ninety percent of the total cost will be borne by the central government and the remaining 10 percent will be borne by the states.” </p> 
                            <p>He said, “This project will bring a mass revolution in Bundelkhand. The land of Bundelkhand is very fertile, which continues to be the victim of drought due to water shortage. This water will change the picture and fate of the people of Bundelkhand. This project will become the lifeline of Bundelkhand. It will bring prosperity and raise the standard of living of the people of Chhatarpur, Panna, Tikamgarh, Sagar, Damoh, Vidisha, Shivpuri and Raisen districts.” </p>
