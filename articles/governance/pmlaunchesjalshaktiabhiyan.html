                            <p>He said it was responsibility of the present generation of the country to play its role in water conservation for the generations to come. </p>
                            <p>While PM launched the campaign a memorandum of agreement (MOA) was signed between Union Minister of Jal Shakti and chief ministers of Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh to implement the Ken Betwa Link Project, the first project of the national perspective plan for interlinking of rivers, as per the release. </p>
                            <p>The Prime Minister also interacted with sarpanches and ward panches in Rajasthan, Uttarakhand, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Gujarat. </p>
                            <p>The PM said a major step had also been taken for the Ken-Betwa Link Canal along with introduction of ‘Catch The Rain’ campaign. </p>
                            <p>He said, “This agreement is important to realise Atal ji's dream in the interest of millions of families of Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh. Rapid development is not possible without water security and effective water management.” </p>
                            <p>He added the vision of India's development and India's self-reliance, was dependent on our water sources and our water connectivity, as per the PIB release. </p>
                            <p>He said the government made water governance a priority in its policies and decisions. In the last 6 years, many steps had been taken in this direction. </p>
                            <p>The PM underlined in this regard Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojna, water campaign to every farm - Har Khet ko Paani, 'Par Drop More Crop' campaign and Namami Gange Mission, Jal Jeevan Mission or Atal Bhujal Yojana and said work was being undertaken rapidly on all these schemes. </p>
                            <p>The PM said just 3.5 crore out of 19 crore rural families in our country, got piped drinking water till 1.5 years ago but with the launch of Jal Jeevan Mission, about 4 crore new families had piped drinking water connections in such a short time. </p>
                            <p>He noted that public participation and local governance model were at the core of the Mission. </p>
                            <h3>CM SHIVRAJ SINGH CHOUHAN</h3>
                            <p>Speaking on the occasion Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said a dream came true today for Madhya Pradesh and its Bundelkhand region in particular, as per an official release from MP government. </p> 
                            <p>The CM said, “Former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee had a dream of connecting the rivers of the country. If the river basins which have more water are linked to river basins with less water, then the water will not go waste and it can be used for irrigation and drinking water purposes. This dream vision has been realized by our glorious and visionary Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The Nadi Jodo Pariyojana is one of the best examples of Sahakari Sanghvad (Cooperative Federalism).” </p>
                            <p>Giving details Chouhan said, “This project will irrigate 811000 hectare unirrigated area in nine districts of Bundelkhand region of Madhya Pradesh. About 41 lakh people will have easy access to drinking water. Contribution of former chief minister Uma Bharti in this project is particularly noteworthy. According to the estimates of the year 2017-18, the cost of the project was about Rs 35111 crores, the present value of which is much more. Ninety percent of the total cost will be borne by the central government and the remaining 10 percent will be borne by the states.” </p> 
                            <p>He said, “This project will bring a mass revolution in Bundelkhand. The land of Bundelkhand is very fertile, which continues to be the victim of drought due to water shortage. This water will change the picture and fate of the people of Bundelkhand. This project will become the lifeline of Bundelkhand. It will bring prosperity and raise the standard of living of the people of Chhatarpur, Panna, Tikamgarh, Sagar, Damoh, Vidisha, Shivpuri and Raisen districts.” </p>
