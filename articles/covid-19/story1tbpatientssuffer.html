                <h2>COVID-19 IMPACT</h2>
                <h4>1.4 million fewer people received care for tuberculosis (TB) in 2020 than in 2019. India figures as one of four countries with biggest relative gap</h4>
                <h5>NEWSONE.ORG CORRESPONDENT</h4>
                <h5>Bhopal, March 23, 2021</h4>
                
                <font face = "Helvetica" size = "4" style="line-height: 1.8;">
                <p>
                        An estimated 1.4 million fewer people received care for tuberculosis (TB) in 2020 than in 2019, according to preliminary data compiled by the World Health Organization (WHO)
                     from over 80 countries- a reduction of 21% from 2019, as per WHO.
                </p>
                <p> The countries with the biggest relative gaps include Indonesia (42%), South Africa (41%), Philippines (37%) and India (25%). WHO fears that over half a million more people may have died from TB in 2020, 
                        simply because they were unable to obtain a diagnosis, as per an official release from the organisation. </p>
            
                    <p>“The effects of COVID-19 go far beyond the death and disease caused by the virus itself. The disruption to essential services for people with TB is just
                     one tragic example of the ways the pandemic is disproportionately affecting some of the world’s poorest people, who were already at higher risk for TB,” 
                     said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General, as per the release. </p>
                    <p> “These sobering data point to the need for countries to make universal health coverage a key priority as they respond to and recover from the pandemic, 
                    to ensure access to essential services for TB and all diseases", stated the release</p>
                    <p>"Building up health systems so everyone can get the services they need is key. Some countries have already taken steps to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on service
                    delivery, by strengthening infection control; expanding use of digital technologies to provide remote advice and support, and providing home-based TB prevention and care.
                        But many people who have TB are unable to access the care they need. WHO fears that over half a million more people may have died from TB in 2020, 
                        simply because they were unable to obtain a diagnosis", says the release.</p>
                    <p> "This is not a new problem: before COVID-19 struck, the gap between the estimated number of people developing TB each year and the annual number of people 
                        officially reported as diagnosed with TB was about 3 million. The pandemic has greatly exacerbated the situation.
                        One way to address this is through restored and improved TB screening to rapidly identify people with TB infection or TB disease. 
                         New guidance issued by WHO on World TB Day aims to help countries identify the specific needs of communities, the populations at highest risk of TB, 
                         and the locations most affected to ensure people can access the most appropriate prevention and care services.This can be achieved through a more systematic
                          use of screening approaches that employ novel tools." </p>
            
                    <p>World TB Day is observed on 24 March each year to raise awareness and understanding about one of the world’s top infectious killers and 
                        catalyze action to address its devastating health, social, and economic impact around the world, stated the release.
